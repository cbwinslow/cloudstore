# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the software requirements for CloudStore, a web scraping and price arbitrage system designed to crawl various e-commerce and auction websites, collect product data, analyze price differences, and identify dropshipping opportunities.

### 1.2 Scope
CloudStore will:
- Scrape product listings from eBay, Amazon, ShopGoodwill.com, and PublicSurplus.com
- Store and manage product data in a PostgreSQL database
- Provide API endpoints for data submission and retrieval
- Implement IP rotation through IP Burger proxy service
- Analyze price differences to identify arbitrage opportunities
- Generate reports on potential dropshipping opportunities

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- **API**: Application Programming Interface
- **IP Rotation**: Changing IP addresses to prevent blocking during web scraping
- **Arbitrage**: Taking advantage of price differences between markets
- **Dropshipping**: Business model where the seller doesn't keep items in stock
- **Firecrawl**: Open-source web scraping model

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
CloudStore is a standalone system composed of several interconnected modules: web crawlers, API service, proxy management, database, and analysis engine. It will integrate with external systems such as IP Burger for proxy services and various e-commerce platforms for data collection.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Web scraping of multiple auction and e-commerce sites
- Proxy IP rotation and management
- Data collection, normalization, and storage
- Price comparison and arbitrage detection
- API endpoints for data submission and retrieval
- Webhook implementation for real-time data ingestion
- Reporting on dropshipping opportunities

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
1. **System Administrators**: Technical users responsible for system maintenance
2. **Data Analysts**: Users who analyze price data and arbitrage opportunities
3. **API Clients**: External systems or scripts that interact with the API
4. **Business Decision Makers**: Users who make decisions based on the analyzed data

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- Linux-based server environment
- PostgreSQL database server
- Python 3.9+ runtime
- Docker containerization (optional)
- Network connectivity to target websites and IP Burger service

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- Must adhere to the terms of service of target websites
- Must implement proper rate limiting to avoid IP blocking
- Must handle site structure changes gracefully
- Must secure API endpoints against unauthorized access
- Must optimize database for performance with large datasets

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Availability of IP Burger proxy service
